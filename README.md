E-Commerce Database Project
 
 
You are working for an e-commerce company and have been tasked with a new project. You will be building a new system that allows users to submit purchase orders to manufacturers for merchandise items. The system also allows users to receive sales orders from customers for merchandise items. These are the minimum business requirements but can be expanded upon.
 
 
 
Database Schema Design
 
Users can have a first name, last name, and an email.
 
Manufacturers can have a company name, a contact person’s name, contact email, and contact phone number
 
Customers can have a company name, a contact person’s name, contact email, and contact phone number
 
Items can have a name and a description
 
A user can submit a purchase order to a manufacturer for an item with the qty ordered, date ordered, and date received
 
A user can receive a sales order from a customer for an item with the qty ordered, date ordered, and date received
 
 
SQL / CRUDL / Express
 
Create Express routes for each of your database tables that performs CRUDL operations. At a minimum you must create routes for basic CRUDL operations.
 
For example, for the Users table, there should be an Express route that allows you to CREATE users. There should be an Express route that allows you to READ a user’s information. There should be an Express route that allows you to UPDATE a user’s information. There should be an Express route that allows you to DELETE a user’s information. There should be an Express route that allows you to LIST all users information.

Add more complexity to your application.

You could also add more tables like a shipments or payments table to contain shipments of orders or payments after orders have been received
